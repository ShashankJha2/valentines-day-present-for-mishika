                I first saw you in sixth grade, and it was like the whole world paused for just a moment. There was something about you that caught my attention right away, and from that instant, I had the deepest crush on you. It wasn’t just a little crush either; it was one of those overwhelming feelings where you can’t stop thinking about the person no matter how hard you try. For almost three-quarters of the year, I found myself rushing to my next class just for the chance to see you, even if it was only for a few seconds. Those few moments of catching a glimpse of you were the highlight of my day, and every time it happened, my face would turn so red. I used to blush so much that it felt like my cheeks were on fire, but I didn’t care. You had this effect on me that I couldn’t explain, and even though you had no idea who I was at the time, you were already so important to me.

                Later that year, Andie introduced us, and I remember being so nervous and excited all at once. I wanted you to like me so badly, so I tried to act all tough around you, thinking that maybe it would impress you or catch your attention. But instead, you called me a donkey. I remember hearing those words and feeling like my entire world collapsed for a moment. My self-esteem took a serious hit, and I was so upset because I felt like I had blown my one chance to be someone special to you. I couldn’t shake the sadness of thinking that I would never have the opportunity to be close to you.

                When seventh grade rolled around, everything started to change. Out of the blue, I decided to text you one day on September 7th. I asked, “Do you want Preet’s number?” It was such a random question, but it turned out to be the best decision I could have made because that single text sparked something I will never forget. From that day on, we started talking so much. We would have these long conversations, two whole hours every single day, and it felt like we just clicked. I got to know you in a way I never thought I would, and it was incredible. By October, I started to realize that I liked you again, but this time it was even stronger than before. I told you that you were my girl best friend, and when you said I was your boy best friend, I felt this huge rush of happiness. I kept dropping little hints here and there, hoping you would pick up on the fact that I liked you, but you didn’t notice because you were such a goofball. We had so much in common that being around you felt effortless.

                Later in the year, around Christmas, our school had a Secret Santa game, and I remember deliberately buying you two gifts instead of one. I wanted to show you how special you were to me and hoped you would notice. When I heard from other people that you were showing off your gifts and seemed genuinely happy about them, I felt this overwhelming sense of warmth and pride. It made me so happy to know I had done something that brought you joy. On the last day before winter break, during dismissal, I worked up the courage to let our hands touch on purpose. My heart was racing, and when you noticed how red I was, you asked if I was okay because you thought I might have a fever. I blurted out, “Is it just me, or are you beautiful?” and then ran off to my bus because I couldn’t handle how nervous I felt. Later, I told you that I was starting to question whether I liked you or not and admitted that I was leaning towards yes. When you said you felt the same, I was over the moon.

                I remember telling you that the song "Love is an Open Door" reminded me of us, but without the love part. A couple of hours later, I asked you out, and you said yes. For a moment, everything felt perfect, like my biggest dream had come true. Unfortunately, it didn’t last long because things got awkward, and we stopped talking. After a month, we started to rebuild our friendship. We went back to being best friends and, eventually, liking each other again.

                There was a time when I lost you for a few months because Myra came between us, but when we found our way back to each other, we made a promise. We promised that we would never lose each other again, no matter what happened. We even talked about going to the same high school and imagining a future where we would still be in each other’s lives.

                Now, looking at where we are, I can’t help but feel grateful. I love what we have, and I wouldn’t change it for anything. I want things to stay just as they are and keep getting better. You mean so much to me, and I hope you know that I love you.
