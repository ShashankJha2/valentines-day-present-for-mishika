        <h1>Why I Love You</h1>
        <p>
            Mishika, I love you in ways that words could never fully capture, but I will try my best to explain. The moment 
            you walk into a room, my heart feels lighter, and everything seems brighter. Your presence alone is enough to make 
            me smile without even realizing it. It’s like you have this magical ability to change the entire atmosphere with 
            just your energy, and I find myself drawn to you every single time. Seeing you is the highlight of my day, and no 
            matter what mood I am in, you always have this way of making everything better.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every time my phone buzzes, my heart skips a beat because I hope it’s you. There’s something so exciting about 
            hearing from you, even if it’s just the smallest message. You are always on my mind, whether I’m busy or free, and 
            the thought of you fills me with a happiness I can’t put into words. I catch myself daydreaming about you more often 
            than I probably should, and it’s because you have this incredible effect on me. Everything about you makes my heart 
            feel alive, and just knowing you exist in my world makes life infinitely better.
        </p>
        <p>
            I talk about you so much because I can’t help it. There’s just so much about you that I adore and admire. Whether 
            it’s your kindness, your intelligence, or the way you laugh, I find myself sharing little stories about you with 
            others because you are always on my mind. You are the first person I want to tell things to, and the person whose 
            opinion means the most to me. You inspire me every day, and I can’t help but feel lucky to know someone as incredible 
            as you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mishika, I love absolutely everything about you. From your perfect smile to your beautiful soul, there’s not a single 
            thing I would change about you. You make me feel things I never thought I could feel, and every moment with you feels 
            like a treasure. You are perfect to me in every way, and I hope you always know how much you mean to me. Loving you is 
            the easiest and most natural thing in the world, and I will never stop being grateful for you. So, I love you.... (one 
            last thing before my final statement lmao dw)
